        <h6>Is it possible to win at roulette without being an expert? As we will see, it is. Roulette occupies a prominent place in a bookmaker precisely because its bets are very simple and intuitive, which makes it possible for even inexperienced people to play and win in it. Here we will see some tips and strategies for the less experienced to perform well in roulette.</h6>

        <h6>Roulette is a mechanical device based on a project by the physicist Pascal that consisted of creating a perpetual motion machine, that is, an apparatus that, once started, would never stop. And although his experiment never worked, the prototype served as the basis for inventing a new type of game in which a rotating disc with numbered cavities was set in motion and then a ball was thrown into the disc.</h6>
        <img src="assets/images/noticias/noti-5.webp" alt="" width="100%" height="100%" srcset=""/>
        <h6>This game, in which it was possible to place bets, soon became popular in the salons of the French aristocracy of the eighteenth century. The Blanc brothers were in charge of spreading the game, taking it to other European countries. The game became so popular that it crossed the Atlantic and came to the United States with some modifications, such as the introduction of the American eagle and the two zeros.</h6>

        <h6>Some players who want to get started in the world of roulette, or even new users of games, should know that in order to have a good performance with Pascal's device, you have to know some particularities, since roulette, unlike card games, allows many types of bets.</h6>
        <h6>Betting, despite being quite simple and intuitive, requires the bettor to know which numbers can be winners with their bet, in order to explore the potential of the odds.</h6>
        <h2>Use the welcome bonus</h2>
        <h6>Let's start by talking about economics! The famous welcome bonus is a way to increase your bankroll without risking too much money.</h6>
        <h6>Take a look at the welcome bonus option offered by Bodog and sign up to receive it. After all, you'd have to be crazy to turn down that extra money!</h6>
        <h2>1. Smaller bets mean more time to play</h2>
        <h6>If roulette is a relatively new game for you, there's no reason to make risky bets during the rounds. The best advice we can give you is: place small bets and stay in the game longer.</h6>
        <img src="assets/images/noticias/noti-7.webp" alt="" width="100%" height="100%" srcset=""/>
        <h6>Ideally, you should set a win amount and, when you reach it, stop playing. The same goes for losses. Before you start betting, set an amount of spending for the game. If, instead of winning, you lose, stop when you reach the pre-set amount. Controlling winnings and losses is part of the personality of a good casino player.</h6>
        <h2>2. Place inside and outside bets</h2>
        <h6>Roulette basically has two types of bets: inside and outside. Bets are divided into two types and are so named because, at the time of placing the bet, the place where the chips are placed can be towards the center (internal) or towards the periphery (external). Inside bets are made on one or more numbers, while outside bets are made on the quality of those numbers.</h6>
        <h6>In inside bets we can bet directly on a number or a set of numbers. Thus, you can bet on the number 13 by placing the chip on top of its box, or on 13 and 14 by placing the chip on the line that divides the boxes of both numbers. In outside bets, on the other hand, we bet on black or red, or on whether the ball will land on the first, second or third dozen, or on whether the number will be odd or even.</h6>
        <h2>3. Avoid using strategies in the game of roulette</h2>
        <h6>This tip is only valid for less experienced players, ok? There are several methods such as the Martingale System, the D'Alembert Strategy and the famous James Bond Method, but they are suitable for players with more roulette skills.</h6>
        <img src="assets/images/noticias/noti-8.webp" alt="" width="100%" height="100%" srcset=""/>
        <h6>If you want to know more, it's worth reading about these strategies; We even have articles about them on our blog. At the same time, keep practicing to understand a little more about this wonderful and fun game.</h6>
        <h2>4. Pay attention to draw patterns</h2>
        <h6>If we assume that over a wide series of roulette spins, the probability of each number coming out is the same, it is worth paying attention and seeing which numbers came up the least and which ones more. The least drawn numbers may be the next numbers to be drawn, which would complete the series.</h6>
        <h6>On the other hand, defying the saying that "lightning doesn't strike the same place twice," numbers that came out more may be more likely to come out again due to small imperfections in the mechanical device or simply due to varying temperature and pressure conditions in the place.</h6>

        <h6>Online roulette games are currently the best option for those who want to enjoy good times, even if they can win money. From its emergence in the eighteenth century, roulette was perfected according to the interests of players and bookmaker owners. The result of material and technological development has allowed more people to access roulette games anywhere.</h6>
        <h6>From a rudimentary mechanical device, many other games of this style were created; some even became player favorites. Bodog offers players the most interesting and entertaining roulette games on the market. Let's talk a little about them.</h6>
        <h2>Classic American Roulette</h2>
        <h6>The blue velvet cloth is an invitation to players who wish to venture into live American Roulette. The classic possibilities of inside bets are: the "pleno", which pays 35 to 1, the "on horseback", which pays 17 to 1, the "street or transversal", which pays 11 to 1, the "square", which pays 8 to 1, the "neighbors", which pays 6 to 1, the "seisena", which pays 5 to 1, the "column" and the "dozen", which pay 2 to 1, and "simple luck", which pays 1 to 1.</h6>
        <h6>With an RTP of 94.74%, this classic American roulette game is a good choice for players who prefer to experience the Yankee way of spinning the roulette wheel.</h6>
        <h2>Spin the Wheel</h2>
        <h6>The Spin the Wheel game is an alternative for those who want to experience the taste of roulette but don't want to waste time learning terms like "full" or "neighbors." With a very modern look and full of new age electronic music, the game catches the attention of those who see it for the first time.</h6>
        <h6>The way to bet is quite simple: just choose a number from 0 to 9. If your bet is rolled, the middle part of the wheel will also spin to indicate which multiplier will be used to pay out your bet. The player will have the possibility of receiving between 1 and 4 times the bet value.</h6>
        <img src="assets/images/noticias/noti-9.webp" alt="" width="100%" height="100%" srcset=""/>
        <h2>European Classic Roulette</h2>
        <h6>More conservative players will certainly prefer European Classic Roulette. The most classic of roulette games is presented in its online version and has all the features and betting possibilities of the classic version of roulette. In addition to offering inside bets, such as straight-ups or horseback, and outsiders, such as dozen or black/red, this game allows bets such as neighbors of zero, orphaned numbers, and third of a cylinder.</h6>
        <h6>In addition to possessing more betting odds, which are only allowed in European roulette, this game has an RTP of 97.3%, which is considered very beneficial for the player looking to make their money go even further.</h6>
        <h2>And finally, play roulette whenever you want</h2>
        <h6>Technological innovations and accumulation have allowed roulette equipment to become popular and develop. Online roulette games, which can be played anytime, anywhere from all kinds of devices, are now a big craze among casino game players.</h6>
        <h6>From our tips, the bettor, even if he is not an expert, can make the most of his time, have fun and even win money. Keep studying and learning, and you will surely reach your goal.</h6>
